# Capstone "Tagebuch"(Diary)
```
My application "Tagebuch" ("Diary") is a simple diary with multiuser feature. 
So you can fill your daily stories alone or use the app together with your friends or family members.
```

# Features:
```
The multiuser feature has a sence of sharing with your ideas, thoughts, todos, life experience or even pictures.
You can add new user during "Sign in" or if you has one already, just login.

Loging in like ADMIN (User name: admin, Password: 1234) will enable you access to "ADMIN feature" - User list,
so now you are able to configure list of users.
Without this Admin permission you have access to the rest of features in the app though.

After login in you can use the main feature - cards.
Each card with story includes + message - story;
                              + tag - to search or sort the whole list of stories;
                              + username - so you can see, who added the story.
															+ image attached;
```
